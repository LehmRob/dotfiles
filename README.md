dotfiles of lehmrob
====================

This is my personal repository for organizing my dotfiles. The initial installation is done with
the following command

```bash
$ ./bootstrap
```

Please keep in mind, that the stow needs to be installed on the system.

To keep the dotfiles uptodate run the following command from time to time.

```bash
$ dotupdate
```

This makes a commit of the current changes and pushes it into the repository.
